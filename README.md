# EnvisalinkEmu
Envisalink emulator for NodeJS.  Simulates Ademco Panels
# What Works
This is a very simple emulator, it doesnt' validate any input, On connection it simply sends the "Login: " response, "OK" repsonse, and then every three seconds after that, it sends what ever response you want to hardcode into it.

I didn't spend too much time on it because as is, it does what I need it to do.  It provides me something for my client application to connect to during testing.

I saw in the envisalink forums that there was a need for this, so I encourage anyone to adapt this as they need it.  Maybe if I have time, I will make it more extensive.
